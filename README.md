# Search and Rescue (SAR) Agent Framework - CSC 581

## Introduction

This framework is for CSC 581 students to develop intelligent agents supporting the AI4S&R project. Students can create specialized agents for various SAR roles such as those listed in this spreadsheet:

Each student or team will choose a specific role within the SAR ecosystem and implement an agent that provides decision support and automation for that role.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pyenv (recommended for Python version management)
- pip (for dependency management)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sar-project
```

2. Set up Python environment:
```bash
# Using pyenv (recommended)
pyenv install 3.8.0  # or your preferred version
pyenv local 3.8.0

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure environment variables:
- Obtain required API keys:
  1. OpenAI API key: Sign up at https://platform.openai.com/signup
- Update your `.env` file with the following:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```
- Make sure to keep your `.env` file private and never commit it to version control.

## Development

This project follows modern Python development practices:

1. Source code is organized in the `src/sar_project` layout
2. Use `pip install -e .` for development installation
3. Run tests with `pytest tests/`
4. Follow the existing code style and structure
5. Make sure to update requirements.txt when adding dependencies


## FAQ

### Assignment Questions

**Q: How do I choose a role for my agent?**
A: Review the list of SAR roles above and consider which aspects interest you most. Your agent should provide clear value to SAR operations through automation, decision support, or information processing.

**Q: What capabilities should my agent have?**
A: Your agent should handle tasks relevant to its role such as: data processing, decision making, communication with other agents, and providing actionable information to human operators.

**Q: Can I add new dependencies?**
A: Yes, you can add new Python packages to requirements.txt as needed for your implementation.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why am I getting API key errors?**
A: Ensure you've properly set up your .env file and obtained valid API keys from the services listed above.

**Q: How do I test my agent?**
A: Use the provided test framework in the tests/ directory. Write tests that verify your agent's core functionality.

**Q: Can I use external libraries for my agent?**
A: Yes, you can use external libraries as long as they are compatible.
